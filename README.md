Ultimate tic-tac-toe!!!
Rules:

Every cell is a new board.
If <i>current board</i> is Main, player, whose <i>global turn</i> is it now, can choose the cell to start a new board.
Player who wins in that cell, can put in it his icon (X or O).
If the game is tie, wins the <i>global turn</i> player.

<i>Local turn</i> shows you whose turn is it now on the specific board (cell).

Have fun playing!
